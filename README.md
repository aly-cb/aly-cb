Hey there! I'm Alice :)
		
As a data scientist and data analyst, I translate data into comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results and make the right decisions.

I am experienced in machine learning and use data visualization techniques to present the results. 
		
I use SQL, Python, Power BI and Tableau for my data projects.
